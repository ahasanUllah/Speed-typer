               <h2>Differance between local storage and session storage</h2>
               <p>
                  <strong>Local Storage</strong> allows JavaScript to store data in the browser. it has no expiration
                  time<br />
                  <strong>SessionStorage</strong> object stores data only for a session. It means that the data stored
                  in the sessionStorage will be deleted when the browser is closed. <br />
                  The <strong>difference</strong> between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does
                  not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

               <h2>Difference between global scope and block scope</h2>
               <p>
                  <strong>Global Scope</strong>
                  Variables declared Globally have Global Scope. A global variable can be accessed from anywhere for
                  example you can access it from a function or if else scope. It can be var let or const no matter what
                  it can be accessed from everywhere <br />
                  <strong>Block Scope:</strong> When a variable is declared inside a function or for loop it's called
                  block scope. In other words a variable declared in curly braces is called block scope

               <h2>What is Event loop</h2>
               <p>
                  The event loop removes the elements from the call stack which will take time to process so it sends
                  that element to the queue. in the meantime other elements which is already in the call stack can have
                  a chance to do their work. When call stack get empty the event loop sends the first element to the
                  call stack from queue.and push it to the call stack which will run it effectively.

               <h2>How to get undifined in JavaScript</h2>
               <p>
                  1. You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. <br />
                  2. If you pass less arguments in function call then that parameter will have undefined value. <br />
                  3. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it.
