               <h2>Differance between local storage and session storage</h2>
               <p>
                  <strong>Local Storage</strong> is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key value
                  pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. <br />
                  <strong>SessionStorage</strong> object stores data only for a session. It means that the data stored
                  in the sessionStorage will be deleted when the browser is closed. <br />
                  The <strong>difference</strong> between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does
                  not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

               <h2>Difference between global scope and block scope</h2>
               <p>
                  <strong>Global Scope</strong>
                  Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed
                  from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar
                  when declared outside a block. <br />
                  <strong>Block Scope</strong> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific
                  block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to
                  be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object
                  for it.

               <h2>What is Event loop</h2>
               <p>
                  The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                  Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                  Stack, which effectively runs it.

               <h2>How to get undifined in JavaScript</h2>
               <p>
                  1. You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. <br />
                  2. If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value. <br />
                  3. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it.
